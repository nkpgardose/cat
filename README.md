## About
cat CSS follows [@fat](https://github.com/fat)'s and [SUITCSS](https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/naming-conventions.md) code guidelines in which it relies on *structured class names* and *meaningful hyphens* (i.e., not using hyphens merely to separate words).
## Install
To try out cat. Do the following commands and be sure to have [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) installed on your device.
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:nkpgardose/cat.git
